Android Splashscreen Java no laptop/desktop build 

My Surface Pro is at the repair shop so I decided to try and build a android app by only using a old spare SG-A6 Tablet. 




# Development Enviroment 
Samsung Galaxy Tab A6.

# Specs:
2Gb-Ram,
16Gb-storage,
Unrooted,
Cracked screen,
S pen (gone)

# Reason
For fun, and mostly curiosity.
